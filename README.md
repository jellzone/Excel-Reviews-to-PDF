# Excel Reviews to PDF

This Python script converts the text in the "review" column of an Excel file into a series of PDF documents. Each PDF file will contain up to 1000 pages, and if the content exceeds 1000 pages, the script will automatically create additional PDF files (e.g., reviews_part1.pdf, reviews_part2.pdf, etc.).

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pandas
- openpyxl
- reportlab

## Installation Guide

1. Clone the repository or download the script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jellzone/Excel-Reviews-to-PDF.git
```

2. Change the directory
```cd excel-reviews-to-pdf```

3. Install the required Python libraries:

```pip install pandas openpyxl reportlab```

4. Edit the main.py file and replace example.xlsx with the path to your Excel file and 'Sheet1' with the name of the worksheet containing the "review" column.

5. Run the script:
python main.py

The generated PDF files will be saved in the same directory as the script.

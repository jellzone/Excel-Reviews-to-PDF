# Excel-Reviews-to-PDF
This Python script converts the text in the "review" column of an Excel file into a series of PDF documents. Each PDF file will contain up to 1000 pages, and if the content exceeds 1000 pages, the script will automatically create additional PDF files (e.g., reviews_part1.pdf, reviews_part2.pdf, etc.).
